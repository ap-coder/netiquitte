Phillip So here is how I would like the sidebar laid out Starting form the top:

Dashboard:

User Management:
  ☐ Users
  ☐ Roles
  ☐ Permissions
  ☐ User Alerts
  ☐ (Not sure what teams are)

Affiliates:
  ☐ All
  ☐ Active
  ☐ Inactive
  ☐ Suspended
  ☐ Balances

Advertisers:
  ☐ Active
  ☐ Inactive
  ☐ Pending
  ☐ Suspended

Offers:
  ☐ All
  ☐ Active
  ☐ Paused
  ☐ Pending
  ☐ Deleted

Mail Room:
  ☐ Template
  ☐ Add Image
  ☐ Send
  ☐ Logs
  ☐ Unsubscribe

Tools:
  ☐ Calendar
  ☐ Messages
  ☐ Tasks
  ☐ Offer Descriptions

PROSPRIO- This section should be set up as a separate module that can be turned off if needed, also this section would need permission to view/edit. This will work with Hasoffers API:

Affiliates:
  ☐ All
  ☐ Active
  ☐ Inactive
  ☐ Suspended
  ☐ Balances
