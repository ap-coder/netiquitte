Hey Philip,

Hope you are doing well, so the easiest way for me to show you how the accounting system would work is by giving a link to a Google Doc that we currently use.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b9LMg-0G1CmfJrpyAnA4lDV3sMy5xt9-6O5P_-z-dn0/edit?usp=sharing

Column 1 = Affiliate ID
Column 2 = Affiliate Company Name
Columns 3 - 14 are the months January - Dec. Every Affiliate who generates revenue "Payout"  for us should be listed in this section and the amount of revenue generated per month with column 15 giving us a total for each Publisher.
(This will repeat for each Year.)

How this should work initially, is that all of the data in terms "payout" for each month should be called from January to the current month.

If for example, we need to update the current month or we need the ability to click Manual Update, where the API will then update the current month.

For each month when Clicked on A Card Style option should open so we can make edit's and have various options.

You can find all of this in the HQ Login under Affiliates - Balances, YOu should get a solid idea of how this works form the Google Doc as well as by having a look at HQ.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
